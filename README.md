### Updating the LNURL-pay String

To use your own Lightning tip address:

1. Open `src/pages/Index.tsx`
2. Find the `LNURL` constant (around line 13)
3. Replace the string with your static LNURL-pay link:

```javascript
const LNURL = "your_lnurl_pay_string_here";
```

### How to Get a Static LNURL-pay String

1. Use a Lightning service provider that offers static LNURL-pay (like LNbits, BTCPay Server, or Alby)
2. Generate a static LNURL-pay link from your Lightning node
3. The string should start with `lnurl1` and be bech32 encoded

   - Phoenix Wallet
   - Breez
   - Wallet of Satoshi
   - Alby Extension
